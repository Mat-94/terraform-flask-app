Terraform + Flask Web Application Deployment
Project Overview:
This project involves automating the deployment of a Flask-based web application using Terraform on an AWS EC2 instance. The web application is a simple Python Flask app that displays a message ("Hello, Terraform!") when accessed. The project showcases my ability to utilize infrastructure-as-code practices with Terraform to provision cloud resources and deploy a web application in an automated and repeatable manner.

Key Features & Technologies:

Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):
Utilized Terraform to create an EC2 instance, configure security groups, and set up necessary resources for a scalable web application environment.
Cloud Infrastructure:
Deployed the application on AWS EC2, ensuring proper configuration of the instance and security for secure access.
Web Application:
Developed a simple Flask application to demonstrate web development skills and to provide the basic functionality of serving HTTP requests.
Networking:
Configured the EC2 instance's networking settings to ensure accessibility over the web and adjusted firewall (UFW) settings to allow traffic on the applicationâ€™s port (5000).
Security:
Implemented best practices for cloud security by configuring security groups to restrict access and enabling secure SSH access to the instance.
Version Control:
Managed the codebase using Git, ensuring version control and collaborative development in a reproducible environment.
Automation & Efficiency:
Used Terraform scripts to automate the process of provisioning infrastructure, reducing setup time and improving deployment efficiency.
Outcome & Impact:
The project successfully demonstrates the integration of infrastructure automation (Terraform) with web application development (Flask). It highlights my ability to deploy applications to the cloud, manage configurations, and work with essential cloud services such as EC2, security groups, and firewall configurations.
